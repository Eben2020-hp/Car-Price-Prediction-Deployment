# PROBLEM
We had faced a small problem while deploying. The pickle file was a bit more than 100MB. So when we uploaded some bits were missing.
Due to this we couldn't deploy as our Deployment Server could not take the whole model into consideation.

But Dispite of that I would like to show how it would have looked.
